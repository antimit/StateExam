a) Definition:
DFA is a 5-tuple (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F) where δ: Q × Σ → Q is total and deterministic (for each state and input symbol there is exactly one next state). No ε-moves allowed.

b) Determinization algorithm:
Convert NFA → DFA using subset construction: each DFA state = set of NFA states. Start = ε-closure of NFA start. For each symbol, compute reachable states. Final DFA states are those containing at least one NFA final state.
