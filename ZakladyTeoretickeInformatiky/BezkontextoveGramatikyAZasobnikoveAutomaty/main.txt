For a fixed input string w, a PDA may follow many possible paths because it is nondeterministic.
If at least one path consumes all of w and ends in acceptance (final state or empty stack),
then M has an accepting computation on w and w is in L(M).



3)Chomského normální forma BG: definice a metoda pˇrevodu gramatiky do CNF

Definition:
A context-free grammar is in CNF if every production is of one of the following forms:

A → BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals and B, C are not the start symbol.

A → a, where a is a terminal.

S → ε, only allowed if the language includes the empty string (and only for the start symbol).

Explanation:

The right-hand side of every rule is either exactly two non-terminals or exactly one terminal.

No other forms like A → BCD, A → aB, or A → ε (unless it is the start symbol).

CNF is useful because it simplifies grammars into a standard form and is required for algorithms like CYK parsing.



Conversion method (sketch):

Remove ε-productions (A → ε), except possibly for the start symbol.

Remove unit productions (A → B).

Remove useless symbols (non-terminals that never lead to terminals).

Convert the remaining rules into CNF form (A → BC or A → a).

Every CFG can be converted into an equivalent CFG in CNF that generates the same language (except possibly ε).
