Explanation:

When physical RAM is not enough to hold all active pages of all processes, the operating system uses virtual memory. Part of the virtual memory is backed by disk (the swap file or pagefile).

Since disk access is very slow compared to RAM, the OS must decide which pages in RAM should be moved (swapped out) to disk to make space for new pages. This decision is called the page replacement policy.

Common strategies for selecting pages:

FIFO (First-In, First-Out):
The oldest loaded page is swapped out first. Simple, but not always optimal.

LRU (Least Recently Used):
The page that has not been used for the longest time is swapped out. Closer to optimal, but requires tracking usage.

Clock / Second-Chance Algorithm:
An efficient approximation of LRU. Pages are arranged in a circle with a “hand” that gives each page a second chance before eviction.

Optimal (theoretical):
Swap out the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future. Impossible in practice, but used as a benchmark.

How it works in practice:

When a program needs a page that is not in RAM, a page fault occurs.

The OS looks for a free frame in physical memory.

If no free frame is available, the OS must select a victim page using one of the replacement strategies.

That page is written to the swap file on disk if it was modified, and its frame is reassigned to the new page.

Later, if the swapped-out page is needed again, another page fault occurs, and it is read back into RAM.
